## Creating a stream

Creating a stream is super easy.

You'll start recving new submissions to that channel shortly

{% hint style="warning" %}
If its a subreddit RedditBot hasn't seen before, it can take up to 5 minutes or so
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
[NSFW content isn't allowed in non-nsfw channels.](../topics/nsfw.md)

Some subreddits arent full-nsfw, but their posts can still be marked nsfw, those wont send in non-nsfw channels either.
{% endhint %}

## Removing a stream

To remove a stream, delete the webhook that RedditBot made
